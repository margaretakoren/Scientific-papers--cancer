The latest United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data. OBJECTIVE: To describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Results are presented at the national level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and total fertility rate. We also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer incidence. FINDINGS: In 2017, there were 24.5 million incident cancer cases worldwide (16.8 million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and 9.6 million cancer deaths. The majority of cancer DALYs came from years of life lost (97%), and only 3% came from years lived with disability. The odds of developing cancer were the lowest in the low SDI quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high SDI quintile (1 in 2) for both sexes. In 2017, the most common incident cancers in men were NMSC (4.3 million incident cases); tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer (1.5 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (1.3 million incident cases). The most common causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for men were TBL cancer (1.3 million deaths and 28.4 million DALYs), liver cancer (572 000 deaths and 15.2 million DALYs), and stomach cancer (542 000 deaths and 12.2 million DALYs). For women in 2017, the most common incident cancers were NMSC (3.3 million incident cases), breast cancer (1.9 million incident cases), and colorectal cancer (819 000 incident cases). The leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for women were breast cancer (601 000 deaths and 17.4 million DALYs), TBL cancer (596 000 deaths and 12.6 million DALYs), and colorectal cancer (414 000 deaths and 8.3 million DALYs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The national epidemiological profiles of cancer burden in the GBD study show large heterogeneities, which are a reflection of different exposures to risk factors, economic settings, lifestyles, and access to care and screening. The GBD study can be used by policy makers and other stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer care.","2019-12-01","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","1749-1768","","12","5","","JAMA Oncol","Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years for 29 Cancer Groups, 1990 to 2017","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31560378 PMCID: PMC6777271","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/K424UUPI/Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration et al. - 2019 - Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, M.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a multiancestry meta-analysis of prostate cancer genome-wide association studies (107,247 cases and 127,006 controls) and identified 86 new genetic risk variants independently associated with prostate cancer risk, bringing the total to 269 known risk variants. The top genetic risk score (GRS) decile was associated with odds ratios that ranged from 5.06 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.84-5.29) for men of European ancestry to 3.74 (95% CI, 3.36-4.17) for men of African ancestry. Men of African ancestry were estimated to have a mean GRS that was 2.18-times higher (95% CI, 2.14-2.22), and men of East Asian ancestry 0.73-times lower (95% CI, 0.71-0.76), than men of European ancestry. These findings support the role of germline variation contributing to population differences in prostate cancer risk, with the GRS offering an approach for personalized risk prediction.","2021-01","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","65-75","","1","53","","Nat Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33398198 PMCID: PMC8148035","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/T48LM67G/Conti et al. - 2021 - Trans-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analys.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398198","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence of prostate cancer in Croatia has been rapidly increasing since the mid-nineties; recent data indicates that the trend is levelling off. Mortality data show constant increase since the 1960s, but mortality trends seem to be stabilizing in the recent period; however, Croatia is still in the top ten countries regarding prostate cancer mortality in Europe. Five-year prevalence in 2012 was estimated at 7,592 cases (426.7/100,000), ranking Croatia in the middle of European countries in the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. According to the CONCORD-2 study, five-year net survival in Croatia in the 2005-2009 period was 75.1%, which is lower than in similar European countries. The epidemiological pattern of prostate cancer in Croatia indicates a relatively low incidence, with significant room for improvement in mortality and survival data. Given the recent discussions regarding prostate cancer screening modalities, a debate is warranted and should be encouraged regarding the role of PSA testing in Croatia.","2018-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","27-34","","Suppl 1","57","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30457244","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457244","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prostate carcinoma is the most common visceral tumor and the second most common cancer-related cause of death in males. Clinical outcomes for patients with localized prostate cancer are excellent, but despite advances in prostate cancer treatments, castrate-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer patients have a poor prognosis. Advanced large-scale genomic studies revealed a large number of genetic alterations in prostate cancer. The meaning of these alterations needs to be validated in the specific prostate cancer molecular subtype context. Along these lines, there is a critical need for establishing genetically engineered mouse models, which would include speckle type BTB/POZ protein and isocitrate Dehydrogenase (NADP (+)) 1 mutant, as well as androgen receptor neuroendocrine subtypes of prostate cancer. Another urgent need is developing highly metastatic prostate cancer models, as only up to 17% of available models display bone metastases and exhibit a less typical neuroendocrine prostate cancer or sarcomatoid carcinoma. Moreover, androgen deprivation and relapse should be mimicked in the genetically engineered mouse models, as androgen independence may yield a better model for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The development of such refined animal models should be guided by comparative genomics of primary versus corresponding metastatic tumors. Such an approach will have the potential to illuminate the key genetic events associated with specific molecular prostate cancer subsets and indicate directions for effective therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite excellent results in the treatment of localized prostatic carcinoma, castrate-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer have a poor prognosis. Advanced large-scale genomic studies revealed a large number of genetic alterations in PCa. Experimental models of prostate carcinoma in genetically modified mice could provide new data about the genetic changes in such cancers and help in developing better animal models for treatment resistant prostate carcinomas.","2021-04","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","71-87","","1","50","","Acta Med Acad","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34075765","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/NPRHHQA8/Krušlin et al. - 2021 - Genetics of Prostate Carcinoma.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075765","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have provided detailed insight into genomics, epigenomics and proteomics of prostate cancer, both primary and metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC). Many mutations have been discovered, both those that occur early in the carcinogenesis and progression as well as those responsible for the resistance to therapy occurring later under the influence of treatment. A large number of characteristic mutated signaling pathways has been identified, e.g. the mutations in DNA repair pathway were found in 23% of mCRPC, which suggests potential response to PARP inhibitors. Multifocality and intralesional genomic heterogeneity of prostate cancer make the clinical application of genomics complicated. Although a great progress was made in understanding prostate cancer genomic, and clinical studies related to its routine application are ongoing, prostate cancer genomics still needs to find its standard wide routine application in patients with prostate cancer.","2022-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","86","","Suppl 3","61","","Acta Clin Croat","GENOMICS OF PROSTATE CANCER","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36938554 PMCID: PMC10022402","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/I2T6UXWM/Šamija and Fröbe - 2022 - GENOMICS OF PROSTATE CANCER CLINICAL UTILITY AND .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36938554","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DNA damage response (DDR) comprises several pathways that eliminate DNA damage to maintain genomic stability and integrity, but different types of cancers are associated with DDR machinery defects. Many improvements have been made in recent years, providing several drugs and therapeutic strategies for cancer patients, including those targeting the DDR pathways. Currently, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors) are the DDR inhibitors (DDRi) approved for several cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. However, PARPi resistance is a growing issue in clinical settings that increases disease relapse and aggravate patients' prognosis. Additionally, resistance to other DDRi is also being found and investigated. The resistance mechanisms to DDRi include reversion mutations, epigenetic modification, stabilization of the replication fork, and increased drug efflux. This review highlights the DDR pathways in cancer therapy, its role in the resistance to conventional treatments, and its exploitation for anticancer treatment. Biomarkers of treatment response, combination strategies with other anticancer agents, resistance mechanisms, and liabilities of treatment with DDR inhibitors are also discussed.","2022-11-24","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","14672","","23","23","","Int J Mol Sci","DNA Damage Response in Cancer Therapy and Resistance","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36499000 PMCID: PMC9735783","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/2L9ZXKPL/Jurkovicova et al. - 2022 - DNA Damage Response in Cancer Therapy and Resistan.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36499000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After identifying critical variations in designs and protocols that undermined clear-cut evidence acquisition, and reliable translation into clinical practice, we propose guidelines for most critical steps that should be considered in future research of miRNA as biomarkers, especially in PCa.","2020-03","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","543-558","","6","12","","Epigenomics","miRNA in prostate cancer","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32267174","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267174","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This versatile repertoire is widely used by cells to direct their response to external stimuli, regulate transcription and protein localization and to keep proteostasis. Herein, post-translational modifications with evident potency to drive prostate cancer are explored. A comprehensive list of proteome-wide and single protein post-translational modifications and their involvement in phenotypic outcomes is presented. Specifically, the data on phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation, and lipidation in prostate cancer and the enzymes involved are collected. This type of knowledge is especially valuable in cases when cancer cells do not differ in the expression or mutational status of a protein, but its differential activity is regulated on the level of post-translational modifications. Since their driving roles in prostate cancer, post-translational modifications are widely studied in attempts to advance prostate cancer treatment. Current strategies that exploit the potential of post-translational modifications in prostate cancer therapy are presented.","2021-02-09","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","247","","2","11","","Biomolecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33572160 PMCID: PMC7915076","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/3C5HPMQJ/Samaržija - 2021 - Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prosta.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572160","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last decade, significant advances were made in radiotherapy technology leading to increasing both physical and biological precision. Being a loco-regional treatment approach, radiotherapy requires accurate target dose deposition while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Conventional radiotherapy is based on computerized tomography (CT) images both for radiotherapy planning and image-guidance, however, shortcomings of CT as soft tissue imaging tool are well known. Nowadays, our ability to further escalate radiotherapy dose using hypofractionation is limited by uncertainties in CT-based image guidance and verification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well established imaging method for pelvic organs. In prostate cancer specifically, MRI accurately depicts prostate zonal anatomy, rectum, bladder, and pelvic floor structures with previously unseen precision owing to its sharp soft tissue contrast. The advantages of including MRI in the clinical workflow of prostate cancer radiotherapy are multifold. MRI allows for true adaptive radiotherapy to unfold based on daily MRI images taken before, during and after each radiotherapy fraction. It enables accurate dose escalation to the prostate and intraprostatic tumor lesions. Technically, MRI high-strength magnetic field and linear accelerator high energy electromagnetic beams are hardly compatible, and important efforts were made to overcome these technical challenges and integrate MRI and linear accelerator into one single treatment device, called MRI-linac. Different systems are produced by two leading vendors in the field and currently, there are around 100 MRI-linacs worldwide in clinical operations. In this narrative review paper, we discuss historical perspective of image guidance in radiotherapy, basic elements of MRI, current clinical developments in MRI-guided prostate cancer radiotherapy, and challenges associated with the use of MRI-linac in clinical practice.","2022-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","65-70","","Suppl 3","61","","Acta Clin Croat","MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36938552 PMCID: PMC10022406","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/64R4Q896/Murgić et al. - 2022 - MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER A NEW.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36938552","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last decade, advances in technology, imaging capabilities, and improved radiobiological understanding have deeply transformed radiotherapy for prostate cancer, allowing dose escalation and wide adoption of hypofractionation. Furthermore, the integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and improved physical precision of dose delivery have given an impetus to additionally target intraprostatic tumor lesions, previously agnostic to conventional radiotherapy target definition concept. The emerging data from randomized clinical trials and observation research show that ultra-hypofractionation is a safe approach while further follow-up is needed to assess its efficacy compared to standard fractionation. There is an ongoing uncertainty surrounding true alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer since hypofractionation has so far failed to yield theoretically envisioned superior biochemical control outcomes. Finally, recently published randomized trial settled ongoing controversy regarding the role of elective pelvic lymph node radiotherapy in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, showing clear benefit when pelvic nodes were treated to 50 Gy. The role of partial gland dose escalation/tumor boosting is evolving, and more data is needed to adopt this approach in routine clinical care. Going forward, molecular imaging will be crucial to assess biology of the disease, predict a response potentially, and optimally personalize radiotherapy treatment decisions. In this narrative review, we critically analyzed the published literature and provided practical summary of recent prostate radiotherapy advances for busy clinicians.","2022-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:22","","57-64","","Suppl 3","61","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36938553 PMCID: PMC10022407","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/GQUTSDJN/Murgić et al. - 2022 - RECENT ADVANCES IN RADIOTHERAPY MODALITIES FOR PRO.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36938553","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 1000 Genomes Project-imputed genotype data in up to ∼370,000 women, we identify 389 independent signals (P < 5 × 10-8) for age at menarche, a milestone in female pubertal development. In Icelandic data, these signals explain ∼7.4% of the population variance in age at menarche, corresponding to ∼25% of the estimated heritability. We implicate ∼250 genes via coding variation or associated expression, demonstrating significant enrichment in neural tissues. Rare variants near the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 were identified, exhibiting large effects when paternally inherited. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest causal inverse associations, independent of body mass index (BMI), between puberty timing and risks for breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. In aggregate, our findings highlight the complexity of the genetic regulation of puberty timing and support causal links with cancer susceptibility.","2017-06","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:23","","834-841","","6","49","","Nat Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28436984 PMCID: PMC5841952","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/5ANPIL47/Day et al. - 2017 - Genomic analyses identify hundreds of variants ass.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28436984","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone metastasis develops when the physiological remodeling process is disrupted by tumor cells via the same molecular mechanisms used by native bone cells. The process includes molecular crosstalk between osteocytes and osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteolytic bone metastasis, most often seen in breast cancer, is characterized by promoted differentiation and function of osteoclasts and reduced osteoblast function. Tumor cells take advantage of factors released by bone tissue resorption, thus establishing a vicious cycle that promotes the metastatic process. In osteoblastic metastasis, most often seen in prostate cancer, osteoblast function and differentiation are promoted, while osteoclast activity is reduced, resulting in net gain of bone tissue. Mechanisms involved in the early stages of bone metastasis and cancer cell dormancy have been understudied, and their exploration may pave the way for potential therapeutic strategies. Tumor affects the bone marrow microenvironment via exosomes, soluble factors, and membrane-bound ligands. In this way, an initial lesion is established, which after a variable duration of disseminated tumor cells dormancy progresses to an overt condition. The current review deals with basic mechanisms involved in bone metastasis formation and propagation. We illustrated a disparity between the diversity and number of factors included in the disease pathophysiology and the number of available and developing therapeutic options. We also examined new therapeutic strategies affecting molecular pathways.","2021-06-30","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:23","","270-282","","3","62","","Croat Med J","The pathogenesis of bone metastasis in solid tumors","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34212564 PMCID: PMC8275949","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/3K3E46UB/Vičić and Belev - 2021 - The pathogenesis of bone metastasis in solid tumor.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212564","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-risk prostate cancer represents the most aggressive form of localized disease with significant metastatic potential and poor outcome. Here, the impact of novel therapies will likely be profound and transforming. This clinical space has already been a showcase for multidisciplinary treatment where the combination of local therapies with systemic treatment gradually improved patient outcomes and the chances of cure.

Pelvic lymphadenectomy is indicated in intermediate- and high-risk group patients and with increased probability of lymph node invasion. The most used prediction tools for preoperative assessment of lymph nodes are Briganti and MSKCC nomograms and Partin tables. Pelvic lymphadenectomy can include different lymph nodes group, but extended lymphadenectomy is the recommended procedure. In 1-20% of patients, the lymph node invasion is present.

The purpose of the study was to dissect potential markers and targets of anticancer therapies considering the common characteristics and differences in transcriptional programs of metastatic cells from different secondary sites. To that end, a meta-analysis of gene expression data of prostate cancer datasets from the GEO database was conducted. Genes with differential expression in all metastatic sites analyzed belong to the class of filaments, focal adhesion, and androgen receptor signaling. Bone metastases undergo the largest transcriptional changes that are highly enriched for the term of the chemokine signaling pathway, while lymph node metastasis show perturbation in signaling cascades.

TGFß is active in the regulation of balance between epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis through stromal epithelia via the androgen receptor action. TGFß protects and maintains prostate stem cells, an important population necessary for prostate tissue regeneration. However, TGFß is shown to have a contrasting role in prostate tumor genesis. In the early stages of tumor development, TGFß acts as a tumor suppressor, whereas in the later stages, TGFß becomes a tumor promoter by inducing proliferation, invasion and metastasis. In this review, we outline complex interactions that TGFß-mediated signaling has on prostate tumor genesis, focusing on the role of these interactions during the course of prostate cancer and, in particular, during disease progression.","2019-03","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:23","","128-138","","1","58","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31363335 PMCID: PMC6629207","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/7WX8URGW/Ahel et al. - 2019 - TGF-BETA IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PROSTATE CANCER.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363335","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diagnosis of prostate cancer poses a significant challenge, due to several different key parameters that need to be evaluated, such as age, history of prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinical examination and more recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The current diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer has resulted in overdiagnosis and overtreatment as well as underdiagnosis and missed diagnoses in many men. Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) of the prostate has been identified as a test that could alleviate these diagnostic errors. Before prostate cancer treatment pathological confirmation is mandatory. Prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure with rare but not negligible potential complications. There are several methods of prostate biopsy of which most common are systemic or planar prostate biopsy and cognitive or targeted MRI-guided prostate biopsy. Multiparametric MRI has demonstrated better accuracy and reproducibility in detecting, locating and evaluating prostate cancer and also sparing some men unnecessary biopsies. Recent studies have shown a mpMRI benefit for better procedure planning regarding prostate cancer location, extent of disease and length of the urethra. There are still some challenges ahead, such as ensuring high-quality execution and reporting of mpMRI and ensuring that this diagnostic pathway is cost-effective. According to the latest urological clinical guidelines mpMRI became fundamental tool in management of prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to give a brief insight in use of mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.","2022-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:23","","92-94","","Suppl 3","61","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36938547 PMCID: PMC10022408","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/JIQLY6A3/Nikles et al. - 2022 - CURRENT ROLE OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN THE .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36938547","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During aging a progressive decline in testosterone levels begins, caused by disability of aged Leydig cells to produce testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone. Surgical treatment of PC can influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis with less impact on it compared to patients treated with radiation. Patients with pre-operative low baseline testosterone level had mean Gleason score higher and AR expression was higher; significantly lower testosterone levels were recorded in patients with lymph node metastases. But some data are conflicting, and some results are opposite to those mentioned before. These data show that there is no significant association between all sex hormone in men and lethal PC or total mortality. In patients with metastatic PC, results showed that elevation of baseline androstenedione levels was predictive of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response; higher baseline androstenedione levels were associated with an improved overall survival. In these patients, the relationship between serum testosterone and PC prognosis varies in different clinical settings and according to androgen deprivation therapy administration.","2019-11","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:23","","64-68","","Suppl 2","58","","Acta Clin Croat","IS TESTOSTERONE PROGNOSTIC IN PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34975200 PMCID: PMC8693551","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34975200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer cells have an increased demand for glucose uptake and utilisation compared to normal cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the overexpression of GLUTs, mainly GLUT1, in many cancer types. As the current standard positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (2-FDG) for imaging tumour cells via GLUT1 lacks in sensitivity and specificity, it may soon be replaced by the newly designed, highly sensitive and specific SGLT tracer α-methyl-4-(F-18)fluoro-4-deoxy-Dglucopyranoside (Me-4FDG) in clinical detection and tumour staging. This tracer has recently demonstrated the functional activity of SGLT in pancreatic, prostate, and brain cancers. The mRNA and protein expression of SGLTs have also been reported in colon/colorectal, lung, ovarian, head, neck, and oral squamous carcinomas. So far, SGLTs have been poorly investigated in cancer, and their protein expression and localisation are often controversial due to a lack of specific SGLT antibodies. In this review, we describe current knowledge concerning SGLT1 and SGLT2 (over)expression in various cancer types. The findings of SGLTs in malignant cells may help in developing novel cancer therapies with SGLT2 or SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors already used in diabetes mellitus treatment.","2018-12-01","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","278-285","","4","69","","Arh Hig Rada Toksikol","Sodium-glucose cotransporters","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30864374","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/ZLYKR68D/Madunić et al. - 2018 - Sodium-glucose cotransporters new targets of canc.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864374","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aimed to assess benefit/harm of routine PLND in intermediate risk PCa patients and to compare diagnostic yield of five different nomograms in predicting lymph node invasion (LNI). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive PCa patients with intermediate risk of biochemical recurrence who underwent open radical prostatectomy (RP) with bilateral PLND between January 2017 and December 2019 at our institution. Partin, 2012-Briganti, 2018-Briganti, Cagiannos and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) values were calculated. To compare accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver-operating curve (AUC) were calculated and then optimal cutoff values were estimated, analyses repeated and compared. To assess benefit and harm of PLND, relative risk (RR) and number need to treat (NNT) with LNI and complications set as outcome were calculated. RESULTS: Total 309 subjects. Average age 62.2 years, average PSA 7.2 ng/mL; 18 (5.8%) had LNI; 88 (28.5%) suffered Clavien-Dindo grade 3-5 complication. AUC for predicting LNI: 0.729 for 2012-Briganti, 0.660 for MSKCC, 0.521 for 2018-Briganti, 0.486 for Cagiannos, and 0.424 for Partin. None of pairwise AUC comparisons based on default and newly established cutoff values were statistically significant. Lowest NNT was for Partin and Cagiannos with default cutoff (≥ 5%). Risks of serious complications between higher/lower than cutoff values were non-significant across nomograms. CONCLUSIONS: 2012-Briganti nomogram outperforms, although not significantly, MSKCC, 2018-Briganti, Cagiannos, and Partin nomograms in classifying LNI in intermediate risk PCa patients.

One of the main obstacles in prostate cancer management is the inability to foresee its course, which ranges from slow growth throughout years that requires minimum or no intervention to highly aggressive disease that spreads quickly and resists treatment. Therefore, it is not surprising that numerous studies have attempted to find biomarkers of prostate cancer occurrence, risk stratification, therapy response, and patient outcome. However, only a few prostate cancer biomarkers are used in clinics, which shows how difficult it is to find a novel biomarker. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins is among the essential processes that govern its fate. Upon activation and ligation, integrins form multi-protein intracellular structures called integrin adhesion complexes (IACs). In this review article, the focus is put on the biomarker potential of the ECM- and IAC-related molecules stemming from both body fluids and prostate cancer tissue. The processes that they are involved in, such as tumor stiffening, bone turnover, and communication via exosomes, and their biomarker potential are also reviewed.","2023-12-28","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","79","","1","12","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38255186 PMCID: PMC10813710","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/GYZSL5ZN/Samaržija - 2023 - The Potential of Extracellular Matrix- and Integri.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38255186","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the mentioned IL-6 polymorphism and CaP risk, as well as to compare the genotype frequency between the different tumour grades of CaP, in population of Eastern Croatia. We analyzed the IL-6 polymorphism in 120 CaP patients and 120 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). CaP patients and BPH controls did not statistically differ in studied IL-6 polymorphism. Furthermore, high IL-6 producer genotypes (GG or GC) were more frequent in controls than in CaP group (86.7% vs 80.8%, respectively, p = 0.147). Also, no statistically significant difference in IL-6 high and low producer genotype frequency was noticed between well, moderately and poorly differentiated tumours. Our results, taken together with other studies on the subject, suggest that IL-6 - 174 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution may differ between various ethnic groups and that a single cytokine gene polymorphism has probably just a minor effect on CaP susceptibility. Further studies should be performed to clarify the link between SNPs of different cytokines and the risk for CaP.","2013-09","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","907-911","","3","37","","Coll Antropol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24308236","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24308236","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cellular metabolic activity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The type of cell death induced by 48-h treatment was assessed using a combination of Annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to detect the percentage of CD44+/CD24- cells, and GM3 and CD15s positive CSCs, as well as the expression of GM3 and CD15s per one CSC, in both cell lines. Compound 1 produces a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity, mediated mainly by apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and slightly (2.3%) but statistically significant lowering breast CSC subpopulation. GM3 expression per one breast CSC was increased, and the percentage of prostate GM3+ CSC subpopulation was decreased in cells treated with compound 1 compared with non-treated cells. The percentage of CD15s+ CSCs was lower in both cell lines after treatment with compound 1. Considering that triple-negative breast cancers are characterized by an increased percentage of breast CSCs and knowing their association with an increased risk of metastasis and mortality, compound 1 is a potentially effective drug for triple-negative breast cancer treatment.","2017","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","759-769","","","11","","Drug Des Devel Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28352152 PMCID: PMC5359006","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/AMXMIH9J/Mastelić et al. - 2017 - Glycophenotype of breast and prostate cancer stem .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated whether including additional SNPs in a prostate cancer polygenic hazard score (PHS) would improve associations with clinically significant prostate cancer in multi-ancestry datasets. METHODS: In total, 299 SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer were evaluated for inclusion in a new PHS, using a LASSO-regularized Cox proportional hazards model in a training dataset of 72,181 men from the PRACTICAL Consortium. The PHS model was evaluated in four testing datasets: African ancestry, Asian ancestry, and two of European Ancestry-the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) and the ProtecT study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare men with high versus low PHS for association with clinically significant, with any, and with fatal prostate cancer. The impact of genetic risk stratification on the positive predictive value (PPV) of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer was also measured. RESULTS: The final model (PHS290) had 290 SNPs with non-zero coefficients. Comparing, for example, the highest and lowest quintiles of PHS290, the hazard ratios (HRs) for clinically significant prostate cancer were 13.73 [95% CI: 12.43-15.16] in ProtecT, 7.07 [6.58-7.60] in African ancestry, 10.31 [9.58-11.11] in Asian ancestry, and 11.18 [10.34-12.09] in COSM. Similar results were seen for association with any and fatal prostate cancer. Without PHS stratification, the PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer in ProtecT was 0.12 (0.11-0.14). For the top 20% and top 5% of PHS290, the PPV of PSA testing was 0.19 (0.15-0.22) and 0.26 (0.19-0.33), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate better genetic risk stratification for clinically significant prostate cancer than prior versions of PHS in multi-ancestry datasets. This is promising for implementing precision-medicine approaches to prostate cancer screening decisions in diverse populations.","2022-04","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","755-761","","4","25","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35152271 PMCID: PMC9372232","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/IEYQ4VFN/Huynh-Le et al. - 2022 - Prostate cancer risk stratification improvement ac.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35152271","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several risk factors can contribute to the development of PC, and those include age, family history, and specific genetic mutations. So far, drug testing in PC, as well as in cancer research in general, has been performed on 2D cell cultures. This is mainly because of the vast benefits these models provide, including simplicity and cost effectiveness. However, it is now known that these models are exposed to much higher stiffness; lose physiological extracellular matrix on artificial plastic surfaces; and show changes in differentiation, polarization, and cell-cell communication. This leads to the loss of crucial cellular signaling pathways and changes in cell responses to stimuli when compared to in vivo conditions. Here, we emphasize the importance of a diverse collection of 3D PC models and their benefits over 2D models in drug discovery and screening from the studies done so far, outlining their benefits and limitations. We highlight the differences between the diverse types of 3D models, with the focus on tumor-stroma interactions, cell populations, and extracellular matrix composition, and we summarize various standard and novel therapies tested on 3D models of PC for the purpose of raising awareness of the possibilities for a personalized approach in PC therapy.","2023-03-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","5293","","6","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36982368 PMCID: PMC10049142","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/N97ZKWUX/Petrić and Sabol - 2023 - Let's Go 3D!

Since it often resembles benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), biomarkers with a higher differential value than PSA are required. Epigenetic biomarkers in liquid biopsies, especially miRNA, could address this challenge. The absolute expression of miR-375-3p, miR-182-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-148a-3p were quantified in blood plasma and seminal plasma of 65 PCa and 58 BPH patients by digital droplet PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of these microRNAs were determined using ROC curve analysis. The higher expression of miR-182-5p and miR-375-3p in the blood plasma of PCa patients was statistically significant as compared to BPH (p = 0.0363 and 0.0226, respectively). Their combination achieved a specificity of 90.2% for predicting positive or negative biopsy results, while PSA cut-off of 4 µg/L performed with only 1.7% specificity. In seminal plasma, miR-375-3p, miR-182-5p, and miR-21-5p showed a statistically significantly higher expression in PCa patients with PSA >10 µg/L compared to ones with PSA ≤10 µg/L. MiR-182-5p and miR-375-3p in blood plasma show higher performance than PSA in discriminating PCa from BPH. Seminal plasma requires further investigation as it represents an obvious source for PCa biomarker identification.","2021-04-25","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","2068","","9","13","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33922968 PMCID: PMC8123314","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/5XUKJQPL/Abramovic et al. - 2021 - MiR-182-5p and miR-375-3p Have Higher Performance .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922968","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aggressive forms of the disease are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and death. Treatment of high-risk local prostate cancer most commonly involves radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without the addition of brachytherapy (BT). The use of surgery for high risk prostatic carcinoma (HRPC) is on the rise, because of its advantages including the possibility of cure with surgery alone without the risk of toxicities from prolonged ADT, accurate staging, and avoiding the influence of PSA originating from benign prostatic hyperplasia on future therapy. Oligometastatic prostate cancer may be considered as the last border of possibly curable disease. Radical prostatectomy in oligometastatic prostate cancer can significantly decrease the risk of local complications but only multimodal approach in selected group of patients may offer opportunities to eradicate tumor or delay its progression. Surgery for oligometastatic disease most commonly targets lymphatic disease with salvage pelvic lymph node dissection, whereas it rarely targets distant metastases. Further prospective, randomized studies are necessary to define the role and value of therapies in oligometastatic prostate cancer.","2019-11","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:24","","21-23","","Suppl 2","58","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34975194 PMCID: PMC8693559","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34975194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Levels of investigated metal(oid)s, various parameters of oxidative stress, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were determined in collected samples. A comparison of the measured parameters between 103 prostate cancer patients and 91 control men from both Croatian and Serbian cohorts showed significantly higher blood Hg, SOD, and GPx levels and significantly lower serum SH levels in prostate cancer patients than in controls. Correlation analyses revealed the significant relationship between certain parameters of oxidative stress and the concentrations of the measured metal(loid)s, pointing to the possible role of metal(oid)-induced oxidative stress imbalance. Furthermore, a significant inverse relationship was found between the blood Pb and the serum PSA in prostate cancer patients, but when the model was adjusted for the impacts of remaining parameters, no significant association between the serum PSA and the measured parameters was found. The results of the overall study indicate a substantial contribution of the measured metal(loid)s to the imbalance of the oxidant/antioxidant system. Although somewhat conflicting, the results of the present study point to the possible role of investigated metal(oid)s in prostate cancer, especially for Hg, since the obtained relationship was observed for both cohorts, followed by the disturbances in oxidative stress status, which were found to be correlated with Hg levels.

It has been associated with metabolic syndrome, reduced bone mineral density, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Although testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) reverses most of these conditions in young hypogonadal men, the risk/benefit ratio of TRT in older men is debatable. AIM: To update the 2015 EMAS statement on TRT in older men with new research on late-onset hypogonadism and TRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review and consensus of expert opinion. SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS: TRT should be offered only to symptomatic older men with confirmed low testosterone concentrations after explaining the uncertainties regarding the long-term safety of this treatment. TRT may be offered to men with severe hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction to improve sexual desire, erectile, and orgasmic function. It should also be considered in hypogonadal men with severe insulin resistance or pre-diabetes mellitus. TRT may also be considered, in combination with proven treatment strategies, for osteoporosis, or for selected patients with persistent mild depressive symptoms and/or low self-perceived quality of life, combined with standard medical care for each condition. TRT is contraindicated in hypogonadal men actively seeking fertility treatment. Due to a lack of data, TRT should not be routinely used in older men to improve exercise capacity/physical function, improve cognitive function, or prevent cognitive decline. TRT must be avoided in older, frail men with known breast cancer or untreated prostate cancer and all men who have had myocardial infarction or stroke within the last four months, and those with severe or decompensated heart failure. The quality of evidence regarding patients with previous prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease is too low to draw definitive conclusions. Any limits on duration of use are arbitrary, and treatment should continue for as long as the man feels the benefits outweigh the risks for him, and decisions must be made on an individual basis. Withdrawal should be considered when hypogonadism is reversed after the resolution of underlying disorder. Short-acting transdermal preparations should be preferred for TRT initiation in older men, but injectable forms may be considered subsequently. Older men on TRT should be monitored at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation and at least yearly thereafter, or earlier and more frequently if indicated.

Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed that will guide the treatment options. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important part of the tumor microenvironment that largely influences cell behavior. ECM components are ligands for integrin receptors which are involved in every step of tumor progression. An underlying characteristic of integrin activation and ligation is the formation of integrin adhesion complexes (IACs), intracellular structures that carry information conveyed by integrins. By using The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we show that the expression of ECM- and IACs-related genes is changed in prostate cancer. Moreover, machine learning methods revealed that they are a source of biomarkers for progression-free survival of patients that are stratified according to the Gleason score. Namely, low expression of FMOD and high expression of PTPN2 genes are associated with worse survival of patients with a Gleason score lower than 9. The FMOD gene encodes protein that may play a role in the assembly of the ECM and the PTPN2 gene product is a protein tyrosine phosphatase activated by integrins. Our results suggest potential biomarkers of prostate cancer progression.","2023-07-15","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:25","","2006","","7","11","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37509645 PMCID: PMC10377098","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/C84RQZHE/Samaržija and Konjevoda - 2023 - Extracellular Matrix- and Integrin Adhesion Comple.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37509645","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although an increase in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation was already associated with prostate cancer progression a few decades ago, the knowledge of the involvement of 4-HNE in prostate cancer tumorigenesis is limited. This study investigated the appearance of 4-HNE-protein adducts in prostate cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry using a genuine 4-HNE monoclonal antibody. Plasma samples of the same patients and samples of the healthy controls were also analyzed for the presence of 4-HNE-protein adducts, followed by metabolic profiling using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS and GC-EI-Q-MS. Finally, the analysis of the metabolic pathways affected by 4-HNE was performed. The obtained results revealed the absence of 4-HNE-protein adducts in prostate carcinoma tissue but increased 4-HNE-protein levels in the plasma of these patients. Metabolomics revealed a positive association of different long-chain and medium-chain fatty acids with the presence of prostate cancer. Furthermore, while linoleic acid positively correlated with the levels of 4-HNE-protein adducts in the blood of healthy men, no correlation was obtained for cancer patients indicating altered lipid metabolism in this case. The metabolic pathway of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis emerged as significantly affected by 4-HNE. Overall, this is the first study linking 4-HNE adduction to plasma proteins with specific alterations in the plasma metabolome of prostate cancer patients. This study revealed that increased 4-HNE plasma protein adducts could modulate the unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis pathway. It is yet to be determined if this is a direct result of 4-HNE or whether they are produced by the same underlying mechanisms. Further mechanistic studies are needed to grasp the biological significance of the observed changes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis.","2023-01-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:25","","145","","1","13","","Biomolecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36671530 PMCID: PMC9855859","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/NZHWIASD/Perkovic et al. - 2023 - Relationship between 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as S.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36671530","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, novel concepts for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer are needed. In our opinion, the role of the non-coding part of the genome, satellite DNA in particular, has been underestimated in relation to diseases such as cancer. Here, we hypothesise that this part of the genome should be considered as a potential target for the development of new drugs. Specifically, we propose a novel concept directed at the possible treatment of metastatic prostate cancer that is mostly based on epigenetics. Namely, metastatic prostate cancer is characterized by the strongly induced transcription of alpha satellite DNA located in pericentromeric heterochromatin and, according to our hypothesis, the stable controlled transcription of satellite DNA might be important in terms of the control of disease development. This can be primarily achieved through the epigenetic regulation of pericentromeric heterochromatin by using specific enzymes as well as their activators/inhibitors that could act as potential anti-prostate cancer drugs. We believe that our concept is innovative and should be considered in the potential treatment of prostate cancer in combination with other more conventional therapies.","2023-10-25","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:25","","15585","","21","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37958565 PMCID: PMC10648476","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/7UHTMVD2/Feliciello and Ugarković - 2023 - Alpha Satellite DNA in Targeted Drug Therapy for P.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37958565","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how this histone modifier affects the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is still unknown. Here we analyzed sequenced gene expression data and tissue microarray to explore the expression features and prognostic value of KDM6B in PCa. Further, we performed in vitro cell biological experiments and in vivo nude mouse models to reveal the biological function, upstream and downstream regulation mechanism of KDM6B. In addition, we investigated the effects of a KDM6B inhibitor, GSK-J4, on PCa cells. We showed that KDM6B overexpression was observed in PCa, and elevated KDM6B expression was associated with high Gleason Score, low serum prostate-specific antigen level and shorted recurrence-free survival. Moreover, KDM6B prompted proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression and suppressed apoptosis in PCa cells. GSK-J4 administration could significantly suppress the biological function of KDM6B in PCa cells. KDM6B is involved in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and combination of MDV3100 plus GSK-J4 is effective for CRPC and MDV3100-resistant CRPC. Mechanism exploration revealed that androgen receptor can decrease the transcription of KDM6B and that KDM6B demethylates H3K27me3 at the cyclin D1 promoter and cooperates with smad2/3 to prompt the expression of cyclin D1. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that KDM6B is an androgen receptor regulated gene and plays oncogenic roles by promoting cyclin D1 transcription in PCa and GSK-J4 has the potential to be a promising agent for the treatment of PCa.","2021-01-06","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:25","","2","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33414463 PMCID: PMC7791132","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/LF2HQX6S/Cao et al. - 2021 - KDM6B is an androgen regulated gene and plays onco.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33414463","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer cells often develop radio-resistant mechanisms that are related to the DNA repair, inhibition of apoptosis or changes in cell cycle. Based on our earlier research on biomarkers that are involved in those cellular mechanisms (p53, bcl-2, NF-kb, Cripto-1 and Ki67 proliferation) and correlation with clinico-pathological parameters (age, PSA value, Gleason score, grade group, prognostic group), we created the numerical index for risk of tumor progression in patients with radioresistant tumors. For each of these parameters, the strength of association with disease progression was statistically assessed, and a specific number of points was assigned proportional to the strength of the correlation. Statistical analysis identified an optimal cut-off score of 22 or more as an indicator of significant risk for progression with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 66.7%.

However, intake patterns of specific alcoholic beverages for PCa status are understudied. The study's objective is to evaluate intake patterns of total alcohol and the three types of beverage (beer, wine, and spirits) by the PCa risk and aggressiveness status. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study using 10,029 men (4676 non-PCa men and 5353 PCa patients) with European ancestry from the PCa consortium. Associations between PCa status and alcohol intake patterns (infrequent, light/moderate, and heavy) were tested using multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Intake frequency patterns of total alcohol were similar for non-PCa men and PCa patients after adjusting for demographic and other factors. However, PCa patients were more likely to drink wine (light/moderate, OR = 1.11, p = 0.018) and spirits (light/moderate, OR = 1.14, p = 0.003; and heavy, OR = 1.34, p = 0.04) than non-PCa men.

As clear differences in efficacy, safety, or tolerability between the available LHRH agonists are lacking, the healthcare management team needs to look to practical differences between the formulations when selecting therapy for their patients. Moreover, as the economic burden of prostate cancer rises alongside earlier diagnosis and improved survival, the possibility for cost savings by using products with specific features is growing in importance. METHODS: A review was conducted to summarize the information on the different LHRH agonist formulations currently available and offer insight into their relative benefits and disadvantages from the perspectives of physicians, a pharmacist, and a nurse. RESULTS: The leuprorelin acetate and goserelin acetate solid implants have the advantage of being ready to use with no requirement for refrigeration, whereas powder and microsphere formulations have to be reconstituted and have specific storage or handling constraints. The single-step administration of solid implants, therefore, has potential to reduce labor time and associated costs. Dosing frequency is another key consideration, as administering the injection provides an opportunity for face-to-face interaction between the patient and healthcare professionals to ensure therapy is optimized and give reassurance to patients. Prostate cancer patients are reported to prefer 3- or 6-monthly dosing, which aligns with the monitoring frequency recommended in European Association of Urology guidelines and has been shown to result in reduced annual costs compared with 1-month formulations. CONCLUSIONS: A number of practical differences exist between the different LHRH agonist preparations available, which may impact on clinical practice. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware and carefully consider these differences when selecting treatments for their prostate cancer patients.","2018-02","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","51-63","","2","10","","Ther Adv Urol","Practical differences between luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in prostate cancer","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29434673 PMCID: PMC5805008","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/NNWFCG6A/Meani et al. - 2018 - Practical differences between luteinizing hormone-.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434673","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we identify that the SNP variant-induced change in PSA biochemical activity as a previously undescribed function mediating prostate cancer pathogenesis. The 'Thr' PSA variant led to small subcutaneous tumours, supporting reduced prostate cancer risk. However, 'Thr' PSA also displayed higher metastatic potential with pronounced osteolytic activity in an experimental metastasis in-vivo model. Biochemical characterization of this PSA variant demonstrated markedly reduced proteolytic activity that correlated with differences in in-vivo tumour burden. The SNP is associated with increased risk for aggressive disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality in three independent cohorts, highlighting its critical function in mediating metastasis. Carriers of this SNP allele had reduced serum total PSA and a higher free/total PSA ratio that could contribute to late biopsy decisions and delay in diagnosis.

In this study, we found elevated levels of microRNA-96 (miR-96) in prostate cancer bone metastasis samples. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which miR-96 deregulation contributes to metastatic progression, we performed an Argonaute2-immunoprecipitation assay, in which mRNAs associated with cell-cell interaction were enriched. The expression of two cell adhesion molecules, E-Cadherin and EpCAM, was upregulated by miR-96, and potential targets sites were identified in the coding sequences of their mRNAs. We further showed that miR-96 enhanced cell-cell adhesion between prostate cancer cells as well as their ability to bind to osteoblasts. Our findings suggest that increased levels of miR-96 give prostate cancer cells an advantage at forming metastases in the bone microenvironment due to increased cell-cell interaction. We propose that miR-96 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer patients by facilitating the outgrowth of macroscopic tumours in the bone.","2020-07-14","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","865-874","","7","41","","Carcinogenesis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31738404 PMCID: PMC7359773","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/VNTNY3I3/Voss et al. - 2020 - Regulation of cell-cell adhesion in prostate cance.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738404","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impaired urethral sphincter function is generally considered to be the most important contributing factor for UI; however, the mechanism of onset and recovery of urinary continence has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this research was to evaluate preoperative functional urethral length (FUL) and maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) as early continence recovery predictors after open retropubic RP (ORRP). METHODS: The research was conducted on a group of 43 patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the period from July 2019 to May 2021. The urodynamic method of urethral pressure profile (UPP) was used to assess FUL and MUCP, and correlate with the postprostatectomy continence recovery. The severity of UI and bothersome were assessed using fully validated International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) and number of pads used in 24 h. Patients were interviewed about the use of urinary pads and asked to fill out the ICIQ-UI SF before and 2, 8, 16 and 24 weeks after ORRP. RESULTS: The median value of FUL (mm) and MUCP (cmH2O) was 69 (28-94) and 76 (16-223), respectively. Correlation and linear regression showed a statistically significant negative correlation between preoperative values of FUL and MUCP with ICIQ symptom score and the number of pads used per day at the four observed time intervals (p < 0.05). Such a result showed that patients with higher preoperative FUL and MUCP values were more likely to recover urinary continence earlier. A value of 65 mm for FUL and 80 cmH2 O for MUCP proved to be the cut-off values for continence recovery in 24 weeks after ORRP. CONCLUSION: Preoperatively evaluated FUL and MUCP seem to be valuable prognostic factors for early continence recovery after ORRP. Further investigation on a larger patient cohort is needed to evaluate the role of UPP in the preoperative management of patients with PCa.","2022-08","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","1431-1439","","6","41","","Neurourol Urodyn","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35670263","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35670263","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Localized disease can be successfully treated, but advanced cases are more problematic. After initial effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy, resistance quickly occurs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of Hedgehog-GLI (HH-GLI) signaling in sustaining androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. We found various modes of HH-GLI signaling activation in prostate cancer cells depending on androgen availability. When androgen was not deprived, we found evidence of non-canonical SMO signaling through the SRC kinase. After short-term androgen deprivation canonical HH-GLI signaling was activated, but we found little evidence of canonical HH-GLI signaling activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We show that in androgen-independent cells the pathway ligand, SHH-N, non-canonically binds to the androgen receptor through its cholesterol modification. Inhibition of this interaction leads to androgen receptor signaling downregulation. This implies that SHH-N activates the androgen receptor and sustains androgen-independence. Targeting this interaction might prove to be a valuable strategy for advanced prostate cancer treatment. Also, other non-canonical aspects of this signaling pathway should be investigated in more detail and considered when developing potential therapies.","2021-07-21","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","14880","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34290270 PMCID: PMC8295376","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/HRRUZWJX/Trnski et al. - 2021 - SHH-N non-canonically sustains androgen receptor a.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290270","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of CLL-related risk factors and CLL-directed treatment is still unclear and represents the focus of this work. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective international multicenter study to assess the incidence of OMs and detect potential risk factors in 19,705 patients with CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or high-count CLL-like monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, diagnosed between 2000 and 2016. Data collection took place between October 2020 and March 2022. FINDINGS: In 129,254 years of follow-up after CLL diagnosis, 3513 OMs were diagnosed (27.2 OMs/1000 person-years). The most common hematological OMs were Richter transformation, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-melanoma skin (NMSC) and prostate cancers were the most common solid tumors (STs).The only predictor for MDS and AML development was treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with/without rituximab (FC ± R) (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 2.79-4.91; p < 0.001). STs were more frequent in males and patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable genes (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.49-2.11; p < 0.001/OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.6-2.24; p < 0.001).CLL-directed treatment was associated with non-melanoma skin and prostate cancers (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.36-2.41; p < 0.001/OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.12-3.97; p = 0.021). In contrast, breast cancers were more frequent in untreated patients (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p < 0.001).Patients with CLL and an OM had inferior overall survival (OS) than those without. AML and MDS conferred the worst OS (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: OMs in CLL impact on OS. Treatment for CLL increased the risk for AML/MDS, prostate cancer, and NMSC.

We estimated the benefit of additional SNPs on performance of a previously validated PHS (PHS46). MATERIALS AND METHOD: 180 SNPs, shown to be previously associated with prostate cancer, were used to develop a PHS model in men with European ancestry. A machine-learning approach, LASSO-regularized Cox regression, was used to select SNPs and to estimate their coefficients in the training set (75,596 men). Performance of the resulting model was evaluated in the testing/validation set (6,411 men) with two metrics: (1) hazard ratios (HRs) and (2) positive predictive value (PPV) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. HRs were estimated between individuals with PHS in the top 5% to those in the middle 40% (HR95/50), top 20% to bottom 20% (HR80/20), and bottom 20% to middle 40% (HR20/50). PPV was calculated for the top 20% (PPV80) and top 5% (PPV95) of PHS as the fraction of individuals with elevated PSA that were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy. RESULTS: 166 SNPs had non-zero coefficients in the Cox model (PHS166). All HR metrics showed significant improvements for PHS166 compared to PHS46: HR95/50 increased from 3.72 to 5.09, HR80/20 increased from 6.12 to 9.45, and HR20/50 decreased from 0.41 to 0.34. By contrast, no significant differences were observed in PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating 120 additional SNPs (PHS166 vs PHS46) significantly improved HRs for prostate cancer, while PPV of PSA testing remained the same.","2021-06","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","532-541","","2","24","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33420416 PMCID: PMC8157993","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/TSYR5TWW/Karunamuni et al. - 2021 - Additional SNPs improve risk stratification of a p.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420416","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy can significantly limit the dose to surrounding tissues compared to external beam RT. However, there is limited data surrounding its safety in patients with prior pelvic RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective chart review was performed at the University of California, San Francisco to identify patients diagnosed with prostate cancer with a history of pelvic RT for rectal cancer who were treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) between 2006 and 2022. Inclusion criteria were biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer with no evidence of distant disease on clinical examination or imaging, and at least one post-treatment clinic appointment. RESULTS: Seven patients were treated with salvage HDR-BT at a median interval of 17.7 years after RT for rectal cancer. HDR-BT doses included 3600 cGy in six fractions (n = 5), 2700 cGy in 2 fractions (n=1), or 2800 cGy in four fractions (n = 1). There was no acute grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxicity, and 1 patient developed late grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two patients developed acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity consisting of urinary frequency and urgency, which persisted through long-term follow up. At a median follow up of 29.5 months after HDR brachytherapy, one patient developed regional and distant failure, and another had seminal vesicle recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: HDR-BT is a safe treatment for patients with prostate cancer who previously received RT for rectal cancer. Further studies are needed to better characterize the long-term toxicity of HDR-RT in this population.","2024","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","173-178","","2","23","","Brachytherapy","Safety of high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for patients with prostate cancer and history of prior chemoradiation for rectal cancer","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38160102","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38160102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, capable of minimizing radiation dose to surrounding tissues, is a feasible alternative. Given limited data, this study examined the safety profile of HDR brachytherapy in this setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with localized prostate cancer and IBD treated with HDR brachytherapy at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), between 2010 and 2022. Eligibility criteria included biopsy-proven prostate cancer, no distant metastases, absence of prior pelvic radiotherapy, IBD diagnosis, and at least one follow-up visit post-treatment. RESULTS: Eleven patients were included, with a median follow-up of 28.7 months. The median dose administered was 2700 cGy (range, 1500-3150 cGy) over 2 fractions (range, 1-3 fractions). Two patients also received EBRT. Rectal spacers (SpaceOAR) were applied in seven patients. All patients experienced acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity, ten of which were grade 1 and one was grade 2. Eight patients experienced late grade 1 GU toxicity, and three patients had late grade 2 GU toxicity. GI toxicities were similarly low-grade, with six grade 1 acute toxicity, no grade 2 or higher acute toxicity, six grade 1 late toxicity, and one late grade 2 GI toxicity. No grade 3 or higher acute or late GI or GU toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: HDR brachytherapy appears to be a safe and tolerable treatment modality for patients with prostate cancer and IBD, with minimal acute and late GI and GU toxicity. These findings warrant multi-institutional validation due to small sample size.","2024-02","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:26","","1-5","","1","16","","J Contemp Brachytherapy","Safety of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in patients with prostate cancer and inflammatory bowel disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38584887 PMCID: PMC10993899","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/NI9FC4H7/Thomas et al. - 2024 - Safety of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in patients.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38584887","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the high molecular, morphological and clinical heterogeneity, the course of prostate cancer ranges from slow growth that usually does not require immediate therapeutic intervention to aggressive and fatal disease that spreads quickly. However, currently available biomarkers cannot precisely predict the course of a disease, and novel strategies are needed to guide prostate cancer management. Amino acids serve numerous roles in cancers, among which are energy production, building block reservoirs, maintenance of redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, immune system modulation and resistance to therapy. In this article, by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we found that the expression of amino acid metabolism-related genes is highly aberrant in prostate cancer, which holds potential to be exploited in biomarker design or in treatment strategies. This change in expression is especially evident for catabolism genes and transporters from the solute carrier family. Furthermore, by using recursive partitioning, we confirmed that the Gleason score is strongly prognostic for progression-free survival. However, the expression of the genes SERINC3 (phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids generation) and CSAD (hypotaurine generation) can refine prognosis for high and low Gleason scores, respectively. Therefore, our results hold potential for novel prostate cancer progression biomarkers.","2023-02-18","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","1309","","4","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36831650 PMCID: PMC9954451","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/V3Z29U2L/Samaržija et al. - 2023 - Prognostic Significance of Amino Acid Metabolism-R.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36831650","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Central & Eastern Europe","","1644-4345","10.5603/nmr.97424","","BACKGROUND: As in disease recurrence, providing clinicians with the exact extent of the disease at the time of initial diagnosis is key in the management and individual treatment of prostate cancer (PC) patients. Intending to examine the usefulness of gallium- 68 PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT) and to determine if there is a correlation between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum values, WHO/ISUP (World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology's) grade group of the tumor and SUVmax (maximized standardized uptake value) values we retrospectively analyzed PET/CT studies performed for initial staging of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 34 studies of patients who underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT as part of the initial staging of prostate cancer. All patients had prostate cancer confirmed by histological assessment after biopsy and had Gleason score and PSA serum values obtained. The mean PSA value was 33.8 ± 40.9 nmol/L (range 2.2-232). RESULTS: Nineteen patients had extended disease (55.9%). The mean SUVmax in prostate lesions was 19.5 ± 12.6. The mean value of SUVmax of PET studies in the high-risk group was significantly higher than those of low risk (23.5 ± 13.2 and 10.6 ± 5.4, p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between the ISUP group and SUVmax value of prostate lesions (Pearson's r = 0.557, p < 0.01). A positive correlation was also found in the comparison between PSA values and SUVmax (Pearson's r = 0.34, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans detected the extended disease in more than half of the patients. Locating disease beyond the prostate gland allowed better informed clinical decisions and modified treatment. A positive correlation was found between intraprostatic SUVmax values and the ISUP group of prostate cancer. High-risk patients had SUVmax values that were significantly higher than those of low-risk patients. The correlation between the Gleason score and SUVmax value can be explained by the increased intensity of PSMA expression as the tumor grade increases.","2024","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","6-12","","0","27","","Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38680016","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38680016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: All CV admissions from the US National Inpatient Sample between October 2015 to December 2017 were stratified by cancer type as well as metastatic status. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of in-hospital mortality in different groups. RESULTS: From 5,936,014 eligible CV admissions, cancer was present in 265,221 (4.5%) hospitalizations. There was significant variation in the admission diagnoses among the different cancers, with hematological malignancies being principally associated with heart failure (HF), lung cancer with atrial fibrillation (AF), and colorectal and prostate cancer with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Admission with haemorrhagic stroke has the highest associated mortality across cancers (20.0-38.4%). In-hospital mortality was higher in cancer than non-cancer patients across most CV admissions (P < 0.001) with AF having the worst prognosis. Compared to group without any cancer, the greatest aOR of mortality was associated with lung cancer in AMI (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 2.18-2.47), ischemic stroke (aOR 2.21, 95%CI 2.08-2.34), AF (aOR 4.69, 95%CI 4.32-5.10) and HF (aOR 2.07, 95%CI 1.89-2.27). CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes of CV admission to hospital vary in patients with different types of cancer, with AMI being most common in patients with colon cancer, HF in patients with hematological malignancies and AF in patients with lung cancer.

These implants have been shown to be as effective as traditional leuprorelin acetate microspheres for achieving successful testosterone suppression (⩽0.5 ng/ml) and lowering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Here we further evaluate testosterone suppression levels from four clinical trials evaluating the 3-month leuprorelin implant, including analysis below the European Association of Urology (EAU) castration level (<0.2 ng/ml). METHODS: Studies were conducted in patients with locally advanced/metastatic prostate cancer: (1) a randomised, controlled single-dose study comparing the leuprorelin implant with leuprorelin microspheres; (2) a single-arm, single-dose study of the leuprorelin implant; (3 and 4) two long-term studies with the leuprorelin implant administered twice, 12 or 16 weeks apart. Patients received 3-month leuprorelin (5 mg) implant or 3-month leuprorelin (10.72 mg) microspheres. Testosterone levels were analysed using radioimmunoassay or ultrasensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Both the leuprorelin implant and the leuprorelin microspheres achieved mean testosterone suppression (⩽0.5 ng/ml) within 4 weeks for >3 months. In both long-term, single-arm studies with the leuprorelin implant, median values of testosterone ⩽0.2 ng/ml were achieved at Week 4 and maintained until study completion (6 and 8 months); PSA decrease was also observed versus baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Long-lasting steady serum levels of testosterone, comparable with orchiectomy and consistent with the EAU-recommended castration level (<0.2 ng/ml), were achieved at Week 4 and maintained up to 8 months in men with advanced prostate cancer who received the leuprorelin implant.","2017-12","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","127-136","","6","9","","Ther Adv Urol","Testosterone suppression with a unique form of leuprorelin acetate as a solid biodegradable implant in patients with advanced prostate cancer","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28588651 PMCID: PMC5444576","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/USWRY275/Solarić et al. - 2017 - Testosterone suppression with a unique form of leu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588651","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the radiopharmaceutical package insert, only 3% of the tracer is expected to be excreted in the urine over the first 4 h. Yet, in clinical practice we noticed a higher percentage of bladder excretion. We sought to evaluate and quantify early 18F-fluciclovine bladder radioactivity and determine whether refraining from voiding before 18F-fluciclovine injection would mitigate it. Methods: In total, 159 patients underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging as part of their clinical workup. The first 36 patients were instructed to void just before 18F-fluciclovine injection; the subsequent 123 patients were not asked to void. The SUVmax and SUVmean of the bladder, aorta, marrow, liver, and bladder volumes were determined. Comparing SUVmean of bladder to background, we characterized bladder radioactivity as insignificant (bladder < aorta), mild (bladder > aorta < marrow), moderate (bladder > marrow < liver), or intense (bladder > liver). Differences between the protocols were investigated. Results: Overall, 22% (35/159) of patients had moderate bladder activity and 8.8% (14/159) had intense bladder activity. A negative association was found between bladder volume and SUVmean A significant difference was found between the voiding and nonvoiding groups, with 38.9% (14/36) versus 17.1% (21/123) of patients, respectively, having moderate bladder activity and 22.2% (8/36) versus 4.9% (6/123) of patients, respectively, having intense bladder activity. Conclusion: Refraining from voiding before 18F-fluciclovine injection results in significantly lower urinary bladder radioactivity than does purposeful voiding before injection. We have modified our practice accordingly, particularly as moderate and intense bladder activity may mask or mimic local prostate cancer recurrence. Mechanisms underlying this phenomenon should be further investigated.","2020-03","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","24-29","","1","48","","J Nucl Med Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31604898","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/WJGQ8F2J/Lovrec et al. - 2020 - Characterizing and Mitigating Bladder Radioactivit.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604898","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), the endopeptidase that degrades extracellular matrix is considered to be overexpressed in prostatic carcinoma related to its growth and aggressiveness. Therefore, the aim was to analyze the expression of proteins TGF- β and MMP2 between both epithelium and stroma of prostatic adenocarcinoma and adjacent unaffected parenchyma. The intensity of TGF- β and MMP2 expression in epithelium, tumorous stroma and adjacent unaffected parenchyma was analyzed in 62 specimens of prostatic adenocarcinoma by microarray-based immunohistochemistry. TGF- β was more expressed in tumorous than in prostate stroma (p =0.000), while no statistical significance in case of MMP2 (p = 0.097) was found. MMP2 was more expressed in tumorous than in prostate epithelium (p =0.000), while no statistical significance in case of TGF- β (p = 0.096) was observed. The study results indicate that both tumorous stroma and epithelium have a role in tumor progression and support potential role of TGF- β and MMP2 in prostatic adenocarcinoma progression.","2022-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","9-14","","Suppl 3","61","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36938549 PMCID: PMC10022412","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/2LG9ASAE/Mašić et al. - 2022 - CORRELATION OF EXPRESSION OF TGF- β AND MMP2 BETWE.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36938549","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased antibiotic resistance has led to the suspension of indication for fluoroquinolones use in prostate biopsy prophylaxis. Several classes of antibiotics have been recommended for routine use. Unequivocal consensus regarding antibiotic prophylaxis has not been made to date. The objective of the study was to assess the diversity of antimicrobial prophylaxis among Croatian urologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms® and distributed to 19 urology public hospital's departments. Answers regarding infection risk assessment, type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis were accumulated. Descriptive statistical analysis was preformed using Statistica 10.0® analytics software. RESULTS: Twelve urology departments answered the questionnaire, representing 63% of urology departments in Croatia. Six different antibiotic protocols have been reported. Fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics (84%). Antibiotic prophylaxis started 1 day before the procedure (92%). Average duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 5 days (75%). In case of increased risk of urinary tract infection, 42% of departments changed the type, and 8% changed the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Neither department performed a rectal swab prior to prostate biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Various antimicrobial prophylaxis protocols are currently being used among Croatian urology departments. Lack of uniform guidelines contributes to protocol diverseness that inevitably leads to further increase in antibiotic resistance. New high quality studies are needed to reverse this trend and to facilitate the establishment of a uniform antimicrobial stewardship strategy.","2023-05","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","415-418","","2","90","","Urologia","Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to transrectal prostate biopsy in Croatia","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36527226 PMCID: PMC10265268","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/W68SIJVT/Neretljak et al. - 2023 - Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to transrectal prosta.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36527226","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the relationship between histological inflammation and total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and percentage of free PSA (f/tPSA) levels in patients without prostate cancer (PC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 106 men with tPSA<10 ng/mL who had undergone biopsy that was negative for PC and who had no clinical prostatitis. Inflammation observed at biopsies was scored for inflammation type in each biopsy core by use of a four-point scale and was then correlated with tPSA, fPSA, and f/tPSA. RESULTS: Different patterns of inflammation were found in each set of biopsies. Regression factor analysis was used to form two groups according to inflammation type: more chronic and more acute. Median tPSA, fPSA, and f/tPSA levels in the more chronic and more acute inflammation groups were 6.4 ng/mL, 1.09 ng/mL, and 15%, and 7.3 ng/mL, 0.79 ng/mL, and l2%, respectively. A significant difference was found in fPSA (p=0.003) and f/tPSA (p<0.001), whereas the difference in tPSA was not significant (p=0.200). Total PSA correlated with fPSA (r=0.4, p<0.001) but not with inflammation type (r=0.12, p>0.010). A correlation existed between inflammation type and fPSA (r=-0.31, p=0.001) and f/tPSA (r=-0.43, p<0.001) in that the fPSA and f/tPSA were lower in the group with more acute inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical inflammation has a significant influence on fPSA in patients with tPSA<10 ng/mL but without PC or clinical prostatitis. Subclinical inflammation is not characterized by elevated tPSA alone but also by a decreased fPSA, a tendency similar to that in PC.","2014-08","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","527-532","","8","55","","Korean J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25132947 PMCID: PMC4131081","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/ART5V462/Stimac et al. - 2014 - Effect of histological inflammation on total and f.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132947","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we hypothesized that designed peptides with a wide spectrum of selective antimicrobial activity will also have anticancer activity, and tested this hypothesis with newly designed peptides. The spectrum of peptides, used as partial or full design templates, ranged from cell-penetrating peptides and putative bacteriocin to those from the simplest animals (placozoans) and the Chordata phylum (anurans). We applied custom computational tools to predict amino acid substitutions, conferring the increased product of bacteriostatic activity and selectivity. Experiments confirmed that better overall performance was achieved with respect to that of initial templates. Nine of our synthesized helical peptides had excellent bactericidal activity against both standard and multidrug-resistant bacteria. These peptides were then compared to a known anticancer peptide polybia-MP1, for their ability to kill prostate cancer cells and dermal primary fibroblasts. The therapeutic index was higher for seven of our peptides, and anticancer activity stronger for all of them. In conclusion, the peptides that we designed for selective antimicrobial activity also have promising potential for anticancer applications.","2020-08-01","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","3526","","15","25","","Molecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32752241 PMCID: PMC7436000","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/IDERPX3X/Juretić et al. - 2020 - The Spectrum of Design Solutions for Improving the.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32752241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Retrospective, single-center analysis of consecutive patients (n = 897) who underwent prostate biopsy (S1) with all 12 cores from far lateral areas (n = 269) or prostate biopsy (S2) with 6 cores from parasagittal and 6 from far lateral areas (n = 628). RESULTS: Crude cancer detection rates with S1 and S2 were similar (39.0 and 38.9% for the first biopsy and 29.4 and 31.3% for repeated biopsies, respectively). Abnormal digital rectal exam, lower prostate volume and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were independently associated with higher odds of cancer detection. Regarding first biopsies (n = 747), there was significant interaction between biopsy scheme and PSA (p < 0.001). Overall, the adjusted odds of cancer detection were higher with S1 (S1/S2 odds ratio = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.12-5.74), but the S1-S2 relationship was conditional on PSA: odds ratios progressively increased with increasing PSA from 0.64 (95% CI: 0.40-1.02) at PSA 5 ng/ml to 39.1 (95% CI: 2.71-566) at 75 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Higher PSA levels increase the probability of cancer detection with 12-core prostate biopsies, but relative efficiency of different procedures appeared conditional on the PSA level. Data suggest that PSA levels should be considered in the choice of prostate biopsy sampling scheme.","2013","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:27","","75-80","","1","91","","Urol Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23614932","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23614932","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only 15 original GWAS tag SNPs remain among the catalogue of candidate variants identified; the remainder are replaced by more likely candidates. Biological annotation of our credible set of variants indicates significant enrichment within promoter and enhancer elements, and transcription factor-binding sites, including AR, ERG and FOXA1. In 40 regions at least one variant is colocalised with an eQTL in prostate cancer tissue.

METHODS: This study examined the in-hospital care (systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy/embolectomy) and clinical outcomes (mortality, major bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke) among adults hospitalized due to acute PE between October 2015 to December 2018 using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 1,090,130 hospital records included in the analysis, 216,825 (19.9%) had current cancer diagnoses, including lung (4.7%), hematological (2.5%), colorectal (1.6%), breast (1.3%), prostate (0.8%), and 'other' cancer (9.0%).

We sought to explore the toxicities, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and efficacy of focal salvage HDR brachytherapy in a prospective clinical trial. This report presents the updated results of previously published data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous external beam radiation therapy and/or brachytherapy were enrolled. Patients received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided, ultrasound-based focal HDR brachytherapy delivered over 2 fractions of 13.5 Gy delivered 1 to 2 weeks apart. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was not used. RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated between 2012 and 2019. At a median follow-up time of 39 months, the 3-year biochemical failure-free rate was 61.8% (95% confidence interval, 44.0%-86.6%), and the 3-year ADT/salvage therapy-free rate was 86.0% (95% confidence interval, 74.1%-99.8%). Seventeen patients experienced subsequent biochemical failure, 9 received ADT and/or further local salvage, and no patients died of prostate cancer. Of the 28 patients who had posttreatment MRI, 26 had a local treatment response. No acute grade ≥3 genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicity was observed. One temporary late grade 3 genitourinary toxicity event occurred, but no late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. No significant decline in urinary or bowel HRQoL was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Focal salvage HDR brachytherapy has a favorable side effect profile, no significant decline in HRQoL, and the 3-year biochemical control rates are in line with those of other salvage options. Early MRI response at the treated site is common, but does not preclude subsequent biochemical failure.","2022","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","e531-e537","","6","12","","Pract Radiat Oncol","A Prospective Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Focal Salvage High-dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35718075","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35718075","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of scientific findings showing positive fitness and health effects of recreational soccer, FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) introduced the slogan ""Playing football for 45 min twice a week-best prevention of non-communicable diseases"" in 2010. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the effects of recreational soccer on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). METHODS: Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar) were searched for original research articles. A manual search was performed to cover the areas of recreational soccer, recreational physical activity, recreational small-sided games and VO2max using the following key terms, either singly or in combination: recreational small-sided games, recreational football, recreational soccer, street football, street soccer, effect, maximal oxygen uptake, peak oxygen uptake, cardiorespiratory fitness, VO2max. The inclusion criteria were divided into four sections: type of study, type of participants, type of interventions and type of outcome measures. Probabilistic magnitude-based inferences for meta-analysed effects were based on standardised thresholds for small, moderate and large changes (0.2, 0.6 and 1.2, respectively) derived from between-subject standard deviations for baseline fitness. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Mean differences showed that VO2max increased by 3.51 mL/kg/min (95 % CI 3.07-4.15) over a recreational soccer training programme in comparison with other training models. The meta-analysed effects of recreational soccer on VO2max compared with the controls of no exercise, continuous running and strength training were most likely largely beneficial [effect size (ES) = 1.46; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.91, 2.01; I (2) = 88.35 %], most likely moderately beneficial (ES = 0.68; 95 % CI 0.06, 1.29; I (2) = 69.13 %) and most likely moderately beneficial (ES = 1.08; 95 % CI -0.25, 2.42; I (2) = 71.06 %), respectively. In men and women, the meta-analysed effect was most likely largely beneficial for men (ES = 1.22) and most likely moderately beneficial for women (ES = 0.96) compared with the controls. After 12 weeks of recreational soccer with an intensity of 78-84 % maximal heart rate (HRmax), healthy untrained men improved their VO2max by 8-13 %, while untrained elderly participants improved their VO2max by 15-18 %. Soccer training for 12-70 weeks in healthy women resulted in an improvement in VO2max of 5-16 %. Significant improvements in VO2max have been observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: Recreational soccer produces large improvements in VO2max compared to strength training and no exercise, regardless of the age, sex and health status of the participants. Furthermore, recreational soccer is better than continuous endurance running, albeit the additional effect is moderate. This kind of physical activity has great potential for enhancing aerobic fitness, and for preventing and treating non-communicable diseases, and is ideal for addressing lack of motivation, a key component in physical (in)activity.","2015-09","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","1339-1353","","9","45","","Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26210229 PMCID: PMC4536283","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/JXNHLAMP/Milanović et al. - 2015 - Is Recreational Soccer Effective for Improving VO2.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210229","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty-six consecutive patients with at least one proven or possible adverse prognostic factor such as pelvic lymph nodes invasion (LNI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), high tumor grade and high preoperative prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level received combination of ART and ADT, while 76 patients received ART alone. The ADT consisted of a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or bicalutamide at a dose of 150 mg per day.

We assembled the most recent cancer registry data to estimate the burden of the 17 most common cancers in the region, from Slovenia to Cyprus and Malta. METHODS: Data were made available for analysis from Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Romania (Cluj County), Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey (Antalya and Izmir provinces). We analysed incidence and mortality of the 17 most common cancers (counts and age-standardised rates, for the most recent year available and for the period 1999-2008). We used Joinpoint regression to quantify recent trends. FINDINGS: For much of SE Europe, there were no marked declines in overall cancer mortality rates during 1999-2008. In men, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates were high compared to other European countries (age-standardised rates (ASRW) of incidence being 50-60/100,000 in most of the countries), and still increasing in Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey. Prostate cancer incidence rapidly increased throughout the region by 3-12% annually, largely without any clear declines in mortality. Colorectal cancer incidence increased throughout the region, as did mortality especially in Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria (average annual percentage change (AAPC) 1.5-2%). In women, breast cancer mortality significantly declined in Slovenia, Croatia and Malta (Average Annual Percentage of Change [AAPC] -2%, -1% and -5%, respectively), but not elsewhere. Cervical cancer incidence rates remained very high in Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria (ASRW>20/100,000). INTERPRETATION: Our data confirmed the North West to South East Europe gradient of increasing incidence and mortality rates of tobacco-related cancers, as well as increasing mortality rates of screen-detectable cancers. The lack of decline in overall cancer mortality also indicates suboptimal levels of cancer control in the region.","2013-05","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","1683-1691","","7","49","","Eur J Cancer","Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in South Eastern Europe in the last decade","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23265703","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23265703","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Department of Urology at the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center is the oldest urology institution in the Republic of Croatia. The Department was established in 1894, when the new Sestre milosrdnice Hospital was open in Vinogradska cesta in Zagreb. It was then that doctor Dragutin Mašek founded the so-called III Department, which, in addition to treating urology patients, also treated patients with conditions of the ear, nose and throat, eye diseases and dermatologic conditions. Dragutin Mašek had already realized that medicine would soon be divided into fields and had assigned younger doctors joining the III Department to specific fields. As a result, urology was given to Aleksandar Blašković, who founded the first independent department of urology in Croatia in 1926. In 1927, he was appointed Professor of urology at the Zagreb School of Medicine, where he established the first department of urology and was giving lectures and practicals. Under his leadership, the Department of Urology was given the status of a Clinic, a teach-ing department, the first of its kind in Croatia. Owing to all his activities in the field of urology, the history remembers him as the ""father of modern Croatian urology"". Over the course of the following years, department chairs had changed, but luckily for the patients, approach to work had not. Conscientiousness, trust, competence and charity. After all, charity is the idea that the hospital carries even in its name, after the Sisters of Charity who had founded it. In all the decades, the Department of Urology has been following global development paths, objectively legging behind top facilities in the world by only a few years. Overall professional and scientific urology activities culminated in 1998, when the Clinic became the Reference Center of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Croatia for prostate cancer, and in 2011, when it became the European Board of Urology Certified Center. All that has been achieved could not have been done without wholehearted help and cooperation of the nurses, as well as every other department employee from the beginnings of urology until today. Despite its rich history, the Department does not rest on laurels. Today, it is a modern urology department together with its European role models.","2018-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","9-20","","Suppl 1","57","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30457242","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457242","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TFF1 was significantly more expressed in benign tumors, while TFF3 was more expressed in malignant tumors. Gene and protein expression of both TFF1 and TFF3 was greater in lymph node-negative tumors, hormone positive tumors, tumors with moderate levels of Ki67 expression, and in grade II tumors. A strong positive correlation was found between TFF1 and TFF3 genes, and the expression of both negatively correlated with Ki67 and the level of tumor histologic differentiation. Our results suggest that TFF1 and TFF3, but not TFF2, may have a role in breast tumor pathogenesis and could be used in the assessment of tumor differentiation and malignancy.","2018-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","46-49","","Suppl 1","57","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30457247","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this single center, prospective observational study which was done in University Hospital Center Zagreb between December 2012 and October 2014, 69 patients (median age 71 years; range 50-92) with prostate cancer were included. Patients underwent ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT for staging or restaging of prostate cancer. The mean follow-up period was 11.5 months. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to find out if the differences between SUV values of specific and nonspecific accumulation of the tracer are statistically significant. RESULTS: Nonspecific accumulation of ¹⁸F-choline in lymph nodes was found in 36 patients (52.7%). Most of these findings (n = 24) were nonspecific accumulation of the tracer in mediastinal lymph nodes. Other sites of nonspecific tracer uptake were pulmonary hila (n = 20), inguinal lymph nodes (n = 15), and axillary lymph nodes (n = 10). Mean SUV values for mediastinal lymph nodes, pulmonary hila, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were 4.8, 4.3, 3.1 and 4.1, respectively. Mean SUV value of nonspecific sites of tracer accumulation was lower (not significantly; (p = 0.2) than tracer uptake values measured in metastases sites (bone metastases mean SUVmax value - 13.2, metastatic lymph nodes mean SUVmax value - 9.2). CONCLUSIONS: ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT is a valuable and an established functional diagnostic imaging method for staging and restaging prostate cancer. However, nonspecific uptake of the tracer can often be seen in lymph nodes not related to primary disease. Patient history, clinical examination, laboratory tests and correlation with other imaging methods, must be taken into consideration when interpreting ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT findings.","2015","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","56-60","","2","18","","Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26315863","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/W3NZFI92/Golubić et al. - 2015 - The nonspecific lymph node uptake of 18F-choline i.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315863","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Several studies investigated EpCAM expression in prostate carcinoma but none of them confirmed its prognostic role. The aim of our study was to investigate EpCAM expression and its relationship with established prognostic features in prostate carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a cohort of 102 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the EpCAM expression in prostate cancer and non-neoplastic prostate tissue. The percentage of positively stained carcinoma and benign glands was examined in the whole mount of the chosen slide. RESULTS: The extent of EpCAM expression was significantly higher in malignant than in benign prostatic tissue (P < 0.001). EpCAM expression in prostate cancer was associated with established features indicative of worse prognosis, such as preoperative (P = 0.009) and postoperative (P = 0.004) Gleason score and follow-up time (P < 0.001). Patients with higher preoperative and postoperative Gleason score and short follow-up time had tumors with a significantly higher expression of EpCAM. Negative correlation of follow-up time and EpCAM expression indicated that tumors in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) harbored higher EpCAM expression. Moreover, expression of EpCAM was significantly higher in patients with BCR compared with patients without BCR (P < 0.001). Tumors in T3 stage of the disease showed significantly higher EpCAM expression compared with T2 tumors (P = 0.002). Univariate (P < 0.001) and multivariate (P < 0.001) analyses showed that EpCAM expression was a significant predictor of shorter biochemical recurrence free-survival. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed high level of EpCAM expression in prostate cancer and support its potential role in prostatic cancer progression. In addition, EpCAM could serve as an additional prognostic marker for the recognition of patients with an increased risk of disease recurrence that need introduction of secondary therapy.","2013-05","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","468-474","","4","31","","Urol Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21514185","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21514185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metastatic growth in the bone is supported by factors secreted by PCa cells that activate signaling networks in the tumor microenvironment that augment tumor growth. To better understand these signaling networks and identify potential targets for therapy of bone metastases, we characterized the secretome of a patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b (PCa-118b), generated from osteoblastic bone lesion. PCa-118b induces osteoblastic tumors when implanted either in mouse femurs or subcutaneously. To study signaling molecules critical to these unique tumor/microenvironment-mediated events, we performed mass spectrometry on conditioned media of isolated PCa-118b tumor cells, and identified 26 secretory proteins, such as TGF-β2, GDF15, FGF3, FGF19, CXCL1, galectins, and β2-microglobulin, which represent both novel and previously published secreted proteins. RT-PCR using human versus mouse-specific primers showed that TGFβ2, GDF15, FGF3, FGF19, and CXCL1 were secreted from PCa-118b cells. TGFβ2, GDF15, FGF3, and FGF19 function as both autocrine and paracrine factors on tumor cells and stromal cells, that is, endothelial cells and osteoblasts. In contrast, CXCL1 functions as a paracrine factor through the CXCR2 receptor expressed on endothelial cells and osteoblasts. Thus, our study reveals a complex PCa bone metastasis secretome with paracrine and autocrine signaling functions that mediate cross-talk among multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment.","2015-03","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:28","","471-483","","3","14","","Mol Cell Proteomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25527621 PMCID: PMC4349970","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/AJD5ILVL/Lee et al. - 2015 - Secretome analysis of an osteogenic prostate tumor.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527621","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An in vivo functional screen was used to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating metastatic dissemination of PCa cells. PC3 cells transduced with pooled miRZiP™ lentivirus library (anti-miRNAs) were injected intraprostatic to 13 NSG mice followed by targeted barcode/anti-miR sequencing. PCa cells in the primary tumours showed a homogenous pattern of anti-miRNAs, but different anti-miRNAs were enriched in liver, lung, and bone marrow, with anti-miR-379 highly enriched in the latter. The bone metastasis-promoting phenotype induced by decreased miR-379 levels was also confirmed in a less metastatic PCa cell line, 22Rv1, where all mice injected intracardially with anti-miR-379-22Rv1 cells developed bone metastases. The levels of miR-379 were found to be lower in bone metastases compared to primary tumours and non-cancerous prostatic tissue in a patient cohort. In vitro functional studies suggested that the mechanism of action was that reduced levels of miR-379 gave an increased colony formation capacity in conditions mimicking the bone microenvironment. In conclusion, our data suggest that specific miRNAs affect the establishment of primary tumours and metastatic dissemination, with a loss of miR-379 promoting metastases in bone.","2023-07-31","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","3892","","15","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37568709 PMCID: PMC10416931","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/58KVUDR7/Ivkovic et al. - 2023 - Functional In Vivo Screening Identifies microRNAs .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37568709","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Suburethral slings represent one of the less invasive options for postprostatectomy SUI, and a more recent addition is a transobturator sling, the AdVance®. We report our results with the AdVance® sling for the management of postoperative SUI. The evaluation was conducted on 47 patients with AdVance® implant for SUI in our institution (November 2010 - June 2017). Measurements included age, etiology of SUI, duration of SUI, follow-up and pad use per day (PPD) pre- and postoperatively. Patients were classified as cured if they used no pads or 1 PPD for security reasons, or as improved if 1-2 PPDs were used and if there was a 50% reduction in pad use per day postoperatively. In our series we observed a reduction of mean PPD of 5.1 (2-8) to 1.7 (0-4) postoperatively. After follow-up and according to our criteria, the cure rate was 51.1% (24/47) and the improvement rate 27.5% (13/47). The overall success rate was 78.6% (37/47). No improvement was observed in 21.4% (10/47) of patients. Failure rates after sling placement for patients with addi-tional treatments following prostatectomy were much higher (60% (3/10) for radiation therapy and 66.7% (4/10) for urethral stricture disease). Our results show favourable cure and improvement rates and are comparable to results from larger series. The most appropriate candidates for the AdVance® sling are patients with mild to moderate postprostatectomy SUI. The results may be even better in patients without additional treatment following prostatectomy, such as radiation therapy or surgery for stricture disease.","2018-06","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","77-84","","Suppl 1","57","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30457253","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457253","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the outcomes in patients with high-volume (HV) disease remain modest, we aimed to identify patients for more intensified treatment. We report a cohort of 73 consecutive patients with de novo mHSPC treated with early docetaxel at the Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, University Hospital of Split, Croatia, from October 2015 until March 2020. The outcomes analyzed were the occurrence of castration-resistant disease (CRPC) and death from any cause (OS). The median follow-up was 54 (50-73) months. Forty-six (63%) patients developed CRPC and 34 (47%) died during the follow-up. The median time to CRPC and median OS were 16.2 and 58.4 months, respectively. The risk of CRPC was higher for patients with high (above median) values of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR=2.4; 95% CI [1.4-4.5]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1.98; 95% CI [1.1-3.7]), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (HR=1.8; 95% CI [1.1-3]), ECOG performance status >1 (HR=2; 95% CI [1.2-3.3]) and HV disease (HR=1.9; 95% CI [1.1-3.1]). The risk of any-cause death was higher in patients with high values of ALP, LDH, and ECOG performance status >1. The predictive value of LDH was independent of disease volume.

The therapy was well tolerated, although there was one episode of transitory radiation cystitis roughly one year after its completion. After 45 months of follow-up the patient is without signs of biochemical recurrence of PC, with fully restored testosterone level and good quality of life.

Besides surgical resection, treatments for prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Advancement of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent state limits the potential of conventional therapeutic approaches. Bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteosomal inhibitor for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, has been shown to have a positive effect on the inhibition of prostate cancer growth. Unfortunately, bortezomib has a very narrow therapeutic window, which can lead to severe side effects. Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) is a genetically engineered, thermally responsive macromolecular carrier that enables a targeted delivery of the bound molecule because of its soluble property under normal physiologic conditions. In addition, ELP aggregates in response to mild hyperthermia. Using ELP as a carrier, it is possible to improve the pharmacological properties of the therapeutic drug as well as reduce toxicity in normal tissues. In this work, we have investigated the combination treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells with bortezomib and the C-terminal part of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein bound to the ELP carrier. We have found that combination treatment with bortezomib and ELP-bound p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein leads to increased cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis with respect to single treatments. We believe that this approach represents a promising direction for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.","2014-02","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","189-199","","2","25","","Anticancer Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24113592 PMCID: PMC3915535","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/JKY9RCTR/Mikecin et al. - 2014 - Thermally targeted p21 peptide enhances bortezomib.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24113592","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, patients with persistent PSA after prostatectomy may have aggressive disease and respond less well on standard salvage treatment. Herein we report outcomes for conventionally fractionated (CFR) and hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFR) in patients with persistent postprostatectomy PSA who received salvage radiotherapy to prostate bed. METHODS: Single institution retrospective chart review was performed after Institutional Review Board approval. Between May 2012 and December 2016, 147 patients received salvage postprostatectomy radiotherapy. PSA failure-free and metastasis-free survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was performed to test association of fractionation regimen and other clinical factors with treatment outcomes. Early and late toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients who had persistent PSA (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) after prostatectomy were identified. Median follow-up was 67 months (95% CI 58-106 months, range, 8-106 months). Thirty-six patients (52.2%) received CFR, 66 Gy in 33 fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, and 33 patients (47.8%) received HFR, 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions, 2.63 Gy per fraction. Forty-seven (68%) patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 5-year PSA failure- and metastasis-free survival rate was 56.9% and 76.9%, respectively. Thirty patients (43%) experienced biochemical failure after salvage radiotherapy and 16 patients (23%) experienced metastatic relapse. Nine patients (13%) developed metastatic castration-resistant disease and died of advanced prostate cancer. Median PSA failure-free survival was 72 months (95% CI; 41-72 months), while median metastasis-free survival was not reached. Patients in HFR group were more likely to experience shorter PSA failure-free survival when compared to CFR group (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.04). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (CFR vs HFR, HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.04), first postoperative PSA (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0-1.04, p = 0.03), and concomitant ADT (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.6, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37-6.74, p = 0.006) and concomitant ADT (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.6-12.12, p = 0.004). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with metastasis-free survival were the first postoperative PSA (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.12, p = 0.002), seminal vesicle involvement (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.26-9.6,p = 0.02), extracapsular extension (HR 7.02, 95% CI 1.96-25.07, p = 0.003), and surgical margin status (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.03-7.97, p = 0.04). The first postoperative PSA (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, p = 0.02) and extracapsular extension (HR 4.24, 95% CI 1.08-16.55, p = 0.04) remained significantly associated with metastasis-free survival on multivariate analysis. Three patients in CFR arm (8%) experienced late genitourinary grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, commonly used hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen was associated with lower biochemical control compared to standard fractionation in patients with persistent PSA receiving salvage radiotherapy. Reason for this might be lower biological dose in HFR compared to CFR group. However, this observation is limited due to baseline imbalances in ADT use, ADT duration and Grade Group distribution between two radiotherapy cohorts. In patients with persistent PSA post-prostatectomy, the first postoperative PSA is an independent risk factor for treatment failure. Additional studies are needed to corroborate our observations.","2021-05-12","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","88","","1","16","","Radiat Oncol","Comparison of hypofractionation and standard fractionation for post-prostatectomy salvage radiotherapy in patients with persistent PSA","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33980277 PMCID: PMC8115388","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/JPZSXDM7/Murgic et al. - 2021 - Comparison of hypofractionation and standard fract.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980277","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In patients with mpMRI, the detection rate according to PIRADS-v2 reporting system was: PIRADS 1, n = 0; PIRADS 2, n = 0; PIRADS 3, n = 0; PIRADS 4, n = 6/8 (75%); and PIRADS 5, n = 2/3 (67%). In the group of patients with MR-TRUS cognitive fusion biopsy, the prostate cancer detection rate was 8/24 (33%), while in the control group the detection rate was 12/77 (16%), which was statistically significant (t test, p = 0.037, CI 95% is 0.01 to 0.37). Patients with PIRADS ≤ 3 (54%) could have avoided the biopsy.","2018-10","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","40-45","","Suppl 1","57","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30457246","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457246","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PUBMED and Scopus databases were searched for articles published prior to December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and surgical pathological outcomes in PC patients categorized as ISUP GG 4 (Gleason Score [GS] 4+4 vs. GS 3+5 or GS 5+3). Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Ten studies with 42,041 patients were eligible for the systematic review and eight studies with 36,250 patients for meta-analysis. The treatment type of included study was three surgery and three radiotherapy. The other four studies included many kinds of treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and chemotherapy. GS 4+4 was significantly associated with better OS (pooled hazard ratio (HR): 0.52, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.29-0.91) than GS 3+5 or GS 5+3. Positive surgical margin rates were significantly lower with GS 4+4 than GS 3+5 and GS 5+3 (odds ratio [OR] 0.70/95% CI 0.64-0.77 and OR 0.70/95% CI 0.56-0.87, respectively). In contrast, different Gleason patterns in ISUP GG 4 were not significantly associated with CSS (pooled HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.56-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: GS 4+4 in patients with PC was associated with better OS and positive surgical margin rates. It seems likely that there is heterogeneity within ISUP GG 4. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the conclusions drawn from this study, given the limitations of the study, which include the heterogeneity of the population of interest and the retrospective nature of the primary data evaluated.","2021-02","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","42-49","","1","73","","Minerva Urol Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32432435","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432435","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this report, we demonstrate that normal rat prostate epithelial cells (PEC) undergo spontaneous transformation at high passage (p > 85) evidenced by the acquisition of anchorage independent growth when plated on soft agar and tumorigenicity when injected into immunodeficient mice. In addition, we also report the discovery of a minor subpopulation of spontaneously transformed PEC derived from high passage PEC with the ability to migrate through a layer of 1% agar and form expanding colonies on the underlying plastic substratum. Comparison of these soft agar invasive (SAI) cells with low (p < 35), mid (p36-84) and high passage (p > 85) PEC identified marked differences in cell morphology, proliferation and motility. The SAI subpopulation was more tumorigenic than the high passage anchorage independent cultures from which they were isolated, as manifested by a decreased latency period and an increase in the size of tumors arising in immunodeficient mice. In contrast, low and mid passage cells were unable to grow on soft agar and failed to form tumors when injected into immunodeficient mice. Screening with antibody-based signaling arrays identified several differences in the altered expression levels of signaling proteins between SAI-derived cells and low or high passage PEC, including the up-regulation of EGFR and MAPK-related signaling pathways in SAI-selected cells. In summary, these studies suggest that the SAI assay selects for a novel, highly tumorigenic subpopulation of transformed cells that may represent an early step in the progression of slow growing prostatic carcinomas into more rapidly growing and aggressive tumors.","2018-08","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:29","","89-97","","1","105","","Exp Mol Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29856983 PMCID: PMC6071870","","/Users/margaretakoren/Zotero/storage/BM5FIMTK/Šrajer Gajdošik et al. - 2018 - Soft agar-based selection of spontaneously transfo.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29856983","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RRF6A3ZK","journalArticle","2023","Vržogić, Pero; Perica, Ante","Skin Changes in Suspected Lyme Disease","Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica: ADC","","1847-6538","","","Dear Editor, Ticks carry many diseases, bacteria, and viruses and represent a very important healthcare issue both in Croatia and globally. Although most ticks are not infected with pathogens dangerous to humans, some ticks can transmit infectious diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. This is caused by the increasing incidence of many tick-borne diseases over a growing geographical area. Many factors influence which species of ticks are present in a given geographical area, as well as the density of their population and the risk of human exposure to infected ticks. The average morbidity from Lyme borreliosis in the Republic of Croatia is 6.51 infected per 100,000 inhabitants. There can be no Lyme borreliosis without ticks infected by Borrelia burgdorferi (1,2). In Europe, Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex genotype. There are three skin manifestations of LB: erythema migrans (EM), borrelial lymphocytoma (BL), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) (3,4). Herein we describe a female patient with a diagnosis of Lyme disease based on the non-specific clinical picture and laboratory diagnostics, in whom successful treatment led to complete regression of all skin manifestations. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with no previous history of severe illness. Notably, the patient history showed that, eight months prior to presenting for the dermatological exam, the patient had observed the appearance of edema and demarcated macular exanthema around both ankles and subsequently on the dorsum of the right hand, which spread to the left hand and with gradual spread to both lower legs and the lower extremities, with more pronounced changes on the left leg. The initial dermatological examination found pronounced skin changes on both legs, especially the left leg, with erythematous changes in the form of figurate erythema forming confluences up to the size of a smaller palm; the skin of the left leg was partially mottled with normal turgor and elasticity (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). Inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged and painless on palpation. Changes were minimal and discrete on the right leg and were absent on the torso, upper extremities, and skin. Subjectively, there was no itching, burning, or tingling sensation in the affected areas of the skin. The patient subjectively reported feeling well. Family history showed that the patient's father had died from prostate cancer and that the mother had died from melanoma. Laboratory findings were as follows: hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters were normal. Venous and arterial ultrasound of both legs was normal, with the presence of reactively enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes. Lyme disease was suspected based on the clinical picture, with a differential diagnosis of possible livedo reticularis. A biopsy of the skin changes was also performed, with the results showing that the histological picture in the examined material could be compatible with the provisional clinical diagnosis of livedo reticularis. IgM and IgG specific for Borrelia burgdorferi was also performed: IgG was borderline, whereas IgM was positive at 218 U/mL. Over the next 3 weeks, Amoxil 500 mg thrice daily was introduced to the treatment. After completion of the treatment, there was a gradual regression of all skin changes without the appearance of new lesions (Figure 2a and Figure 2b) (Figure 3a and Figure 3b). Patient follow-up over the next year did not find any recurrence of similar skin changes. Herein we have described the case of a patient with atypical skin changes in which the presence of antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi was demonstrated, in which regression of all skin manifestations was achieved after diagnosis and adequate antibiotic treatment. Lyme disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that can generally be observed in three stages: the early localized stage, the early disseminated stage, and the late stage of the disease. However, it is also possible for the different stages to overlap and even for the late stage to manifest without any signs and symptoms of the earlier stages. Early localized stage. Characterized by skin changes - erythema migrans (EM) - usually manifests within a month of the tick bite (usually 7-14 days after the bite) (Figure 4 and Figure 5). EM manifests in approximately 80% of patients, but only 25% of patients can recall the tick bite. The skin changes are usually localized in the axilla, the groin, the cubital area, or around the waist. The changes are generally not painful, but can itch or be warm to the touch. They gradually spread over days or weeks and can grow to a radius of up to 20 cm. Initially, the coloration can be uniform for several days, after which the redness disappears around a central zone (4-6). Multiple skin changes are a sign of spirochetemia and not the result of multiple tick bites. Due to timely antimicrobial treatment, multiple skin changes are much rarer today. In the initial days or weeks after infection, patients with early, localized, or disseminated Lyme disease often present with non-specific signs and symptoms resembling a viral infection: fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain, and regional lymphadenopathy. Fever can be present in approximately 20% of patients. Laboratory findings in this phase are non-specific. Erythrocyte sedimentation can be slightly increased, leukocyte counts are mostly normal, and anemia and thrombocytopenia are present only rarely (7,8). Early disseminated stage. This stage is marked by numerous EM lesions (that generally appear days or weeks after the infection) and/or neurological and/or cardiac manifestations (occurring weeks or months after infection). Some of these patients have no data on the presence of early localized Lyme disease. The most common triad of neurological manifestations are meningitis, neuropathy (usually of the facial nerve) and motor or sensory radiculopathy (Bannwarth syndrome). All these manifestations can appear individually. Cranial nerve neuropathies can often be bilateral. Late-stage Lyme disease. Characterized by intermittent or permanent arthritis in one joint or several large joints, most commonly the knees, and/or more rarely by neurological symptoms such as discrete encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late-stage Lyme disease can develop several years after primary infection, and arthritis can be the first manifestation of the disease, with the early localized and early disseminated stages not manifesting at all. In Europe, patients with late-stage Lyme disease can present with chronic skin changes (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), which is not observed in the USA. It is caused by B. afzelii and is typically localized to the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet. It is most common in women >40 years of age but can also present in younger populations. However, due to early antimicrobial treatment of the earlier stages of the disease, late-stage manifestations are rare (9). The discovery of the etiology of this disease showed that some well-known clinical entities were also a manifestation of Borrelia infection. The etiology of other dermatologic diseases was thus determined, such as lymphocytoma (or lymphadenosis cutis benigna), which was recognized as an entity as early as 1884, as well as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, described in 1888, erythema chronicum migrans (Afzelius-Lipschütz), and the neurological disease called Bannwarth syndrome, the symptoms of which were described as early as 1922 (10,11). LB and all its dermatological manifestations occur in almost all European countries, predominantly in the central part of the continent. The annual incidence is between 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in France to 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in northeastern Poland, 130 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Austria, and 155 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Slovenia (12). The total prevalence of ACA in all European patients with LB is 1-10%, depending on the region. For example, BL and ACA comprise 0.3% of LB cases in Bulgaria. In Norway, ACA comprises 5% of all clinical LB cases, and in northern Italy that number is 2.5%. Establishing a diagnosis of ACA is much more difficult than diagnosing EM or benign lymphocytoma (BL) because the clinical manifestations of ACA can vary. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is probably the most common late and chronic manifestation of LB that can be observed in European patients. The skin changes in our patient were fairly non-specific, based on descriptions from the literature, but positivity for IgM antibodies was important for establishing the diagnosis, along with the very good response to antibiotics regarding regression of skin changes as well as the histological analysis that, according to the pathohistological diagnosis, indicated livedo reticularis, which is in turn also described in the literature as a possible form of ACA depending on the stage of the disease. Skin changes on the lower extremities are often incorrectly interpreted as vascular insufficiency, e.g. chronic venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, hypostatic eczema, obliterative arterial disease, acrocyanosis, livedo reticularis, or lymphoedema, but they can also be the result of ACA, as in our case (13-15). In cases such as the one we have described, clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can very often vary and differ greatly from the typical clinical picture. This is demonstrated by our case, which also shows that LB and its idiosyncratic manifestations can lead physicians astray in a condition where failing to establish a timely diagnosis can be fatal for the patient. This case report also serves as a reminder that Lyme disease should be considered whenever atypical skin changes are encountered. Given that ACA is a disease in the late stage of Lyme disease and that the changes in our patient were noticed at the very beginning, the disease did not develop to the later stage.","2023-12","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:30","","225-228","","4","31","","Acta Dermatovenerol Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38651851","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38651851","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From April 2015 to May 2019, 71 patients with mCRPC were treated with abiraterone acetate (N = 34) or enzalutamide (N = 37) at our institution. Resistance to treatment was defined as radiological or scintigraphic progression within 3 months, as documented at the first control. After a median follow-up of 14.9 months, resistance was detected in 22 patients (31%). Many of the baseline characteristics differed between responders and nonresponders but did not serve as predictors with clinically acceptable certainty. To overcome this, the resistance score was defined as the number of positive out of the following six predictors: Most patients with resistance and a few responders had >3 positive predictors. Therefore, by using a cutoff of four positive predictors, the resistance score showed both a high sensitivity of 82% [57-96%; 95% confidence interval (CI)] and a specificity of 88% (74-96%; 95% CI). The proposed resistance score integrates the diagnostic performances of multiple predictors and may serve to decide which patients with mCRPC should be offered treatments other than hormonal therapy.","2020-08","2024-05-20 21:44:11","2024-05-20 21:44:30","","742-746","","7","31","","Anticancer Drugs","Predictors of resistance to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in post-docetaxel setting","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32516165","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
